Q: When would you like to create a remote repository rather than keeing all your work local?
A: When I develop my project in more than 2 computers; when I want to backup my project.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: More flexible of course.
